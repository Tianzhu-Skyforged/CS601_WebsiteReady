Week 2ï¼š

A much rougher journey for week 2. As for a zero experienced person, there is a steep learning curve for using CSS.

-One more page added for more room of styles. General content remained about the same.(Movie page may update in the future)
1)Media queries were used to adapt three distinct differences in how the pages are presented based on the screen size.
2)Selectors are used among all the pages.
3)Tired to be as cretative as possible at this stage.(I am a beginner!)
4)More than one css style sheets were applied to some of the pages.



Week 1:

- I planned on building a web with 4 pages. As the instruction suggested, the website will include but not limited to:
1)At least 5 semantic elements on each page
2)List implemented
3)Table implemented
4)At least one image per page
5)Menu bar implemented
6)A video or audio inserted
